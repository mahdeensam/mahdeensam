Credit & Investment Analyst at Androscoggin Bank  

Focused on FinTech, Private Equity, Educational Technology, and Applied Data Science



## About Me

I'm a finance and data professional with a deep interest in how thoughtful design and technology can improve access and opportunity. I began my career in banking, where I worked on evaluating over $45 million in loans and developed models to better understand risk and support small and mid-sized businesses. Along the way, I became increasingly curious about how financial tools could be made more useful and inclusive. That led to cofounding FinanAI, a project focused on using AI to support individual investors, which was later acquired. Now, as a graduate student at Harvard’s LDIT program, cross-registered at HBS and MIT Sloan, I’m learning how to build more human-centered systems at the intersection of data, finance, and education.
